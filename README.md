# dotfiles
backup of my dotfiles for various software configurations

# Atom
## Dependencies
Atom installed such that "apm install x" functions as expected <br />
Node installed such that "npm install x" functions as expected <br />

## A note about Atom
These install scripts assume a fresh install of atom and that your keymap.cson
file has not been altered in any way. They work by cat-ing into the local file,
and as such the scripts may not function as expected with an existing file or
repeated runs.

# Vim
Assumes nothing because Vim is beautiful just the way it is

# i3-gaps
Presumes installation of several software utilities
<!--Todo: create list of utilities and install script for i3-->
